All codes for Proteo-Chemometrics Interaction Fingerprints (PrtCmm IFPs) feature generators is adopted from the original code (https://github.com/debbydanwang/IFPscore). Some lines were modified for the REINDEER software. For more information about this method check the [Proteo-chemometrics interaction fingerprints of proteinâ€“ligand complexes predict binding affinity](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/17/2570/6154300) paper.
